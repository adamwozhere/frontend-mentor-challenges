## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Progressive enhancement
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM


### What I learned

I originally looked into creating a css-only accordion using `<input type="checkbox">`'s but then came across some articles about accessibility and decided on using javascript instead. Accessibility, ARIA attributes etc. still confuse me sometimes but I tried to implement them to the best of my understanding. I also found Heydon Pickering's article about creating collapsible sections using 'Progressive Enhancement' very interesting, so I tried to implement this so that the accordion is still viewable without javascript.

The basic html structure for the accordion is just `<h2>` tags with a corresponding `<div>` element containing the panel content:

```html
<div class="faq-card__content flow">
  <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <div class="accordion flow" data-component="accordion">
      <h2>How many team members can I invite?</h2>
        <div>
          <p>You can invite up to 2 additional users on the Free plan. There is no limit on
              team members for the Premium plan.</p>
        </div>

        ...

```

The javascript then selects the element via the `data-component="accordion"` attribute, then inserts the html needed to make it work as an accordion component:

```html
<div class="faq-card__content flow">
  <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <div class="accordion flow accordion--enabled" data-component="accordion">
      <h2 class="accordion__heading">
        <button id="accordion-btn-0" ... >
          How many team members can I invite?
          <span><svg class="accordion__arrow" ... ></svg></span>
        </button>
      </h2>
        <div data-component="accordion-panel" ... >
          <p>You can invite up to 2 additional users on the Free plan. There is no limit on
              team members for the Premium plan.</p>
        </div>

        ...

```

This allows the page to render the accordion as just a flow of headings and paragraph elements when javascript is disabled, or fails to load etc. But when it is available the accordion is enhanced fully as an interactive component.


### Continued development

In the future I would look more into accessibility, web components, and making javascript code reusable with classes.
