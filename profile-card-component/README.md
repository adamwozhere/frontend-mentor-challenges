## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM CSS

### What I learned

The main challenge I found with this project was with the background pattern elements: I learnt how to use multiple backgrounds and position them correctly for the the desktop design; but they don't quite match up for the mobile view. I'm unsure if there is a better way of implementing this so that the patterns move dynamically so that they line up correctly for mobile, or if this is simply not possible. However I think the mobile view still looks suitable.
