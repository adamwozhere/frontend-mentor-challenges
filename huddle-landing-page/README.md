## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CUBE CSS


### What I learned

I used CSS Grid to create the desktop layout -- keeping the text content to a fairly large size, and then allowing the illustration to take up the remaining space; first starting off small then reaching full size at the maximum page width. Perhaps this may have been better using Flexbox instead.

I did find some of the layout tricky as I needed to offset elements by a few pixels in certain places to match the design image. Maybe there is a better way of doing this; perhaps I should have made a grid layout on the whole page rather than just the main section that contains the illustration and text content.
