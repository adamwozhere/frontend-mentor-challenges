## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CUBE CSS
- Accessibility

### What I learned

With this project I have tried to keep accessibility in mind; although I'm unsure if it is the correct / ideal implementation. The select buttons are a part of a `fieldset` with `role="radiogroup"` and a `legend` that is visually hidden. As the card is a `form`, I included error checking so that if the form is submitted without selecting a rating, then an error message is displayed. I have not looked into fully checking accessibility but I think that the error message would be announced when using a screenreader because of the `role="alert"` attribute:

```html
<strong class="alert" id="error-msg" role="alert" hidden>Select a rating from 1 to 5</strong>
```
This seems like a sensible solution as it means the error message is styled to match the card rather than being a browser-styled popup as with other form inputs / elements.

### Useful Resources

- [Accessible validation of checkbox and radiobutton groups](https://blog.tenon.io/accessible-validation-of-checkbox-and-radiobutton-groups/) - I will attempt to follow these best practices more closely in future projects
