## My process

I created this project with fairly basic styling based on the CUBE CSS methodology; but keeping most of the styling within the `qr-code` element as it is a component. On a larger project I would probably use classes as design tokens and apply to the html elements directly to avoid repition in the css.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi) - CSS methodology
