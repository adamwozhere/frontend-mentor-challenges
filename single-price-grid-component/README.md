## My process

I created this project mainly with CUBE css to work with the css cascade more naturally, but with a lot of the component compartmentalised as with BEM -- I wanted to work more with CUBE css, but I found working with token based utility classes a bit more difficult with this project, as there seemed to be quite a varied (perhaps a bit unstructured) method to the spacings and font sizes in the design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi) - CSS methodology
