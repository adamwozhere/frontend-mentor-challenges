## My process

I decided to create this component using some aspects of CUBE CSS but leaning more heavily on a BEM style for containing most of the properties. On a larger project I would probably try to use more of a CUBE CSS approach with css classes for design tokens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi) - CSS methodology
